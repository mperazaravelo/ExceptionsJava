This is a project that I created during class COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at Valencia College to apply basic knowledge about exception handling in Java.
The objective of this program is to showcase how to throw and catch exceptions, as well as
how to create our custom exceptions so that we can have specific types of exceptions that suit our
problems.
For the first part, the user is going to input two integer numbers, and the output is going to be
the result of the first one divided by the second one. If the second number is a 0, the program
catches an exception and outputs that division by 0 is not possible.
For the second part, the user is going to input a series of usernames and passwords. The usernames need to
be at least 6 characters long and need to have at least 2 vowels. The passwords can only be exactly
8 characters and the 3rd character needs to be '%'. If they do not follow the rules,
an exception is thrown and a message is going to print for the user to try again. After all
the accounts are created, the details are printed on the screen.
